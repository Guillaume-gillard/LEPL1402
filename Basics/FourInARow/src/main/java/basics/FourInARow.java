/**
 * A class that represents a game of Four in a Row.
 * The game is played on a 6x7 board.
 * A player wins when he has 4 pieces in a row, column or diagonal.
 *
 * ForInARow is a two-player connection rack game, in which the players choose a color and
 * then take turns dropping colored tokens into a six-row, seven-column vertically suspended grid.
 * The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column.
 *
 * The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal,
 * vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own tokens.
 *
 * Your taks is to model the game and implement the method hasWon(char player) that returns true.
 * if the player has won the game.
 * We advise you to model the state of the game with an internal 2D array of char.
